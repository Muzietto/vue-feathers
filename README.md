Notable examples:
- [json-for-vue](https://github.com/Muzietto/vue-feathers/tree/master/feathers/json-for-vue), a comprehensive solution with Feathers server+client based on [feathers-fs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/feathers-fs): a REST interface provides JSON data read/written on the filesystem.
